# Abitibi (Platformer PC)	- Global Game Jam 2020

The player is a spirit of the forest and needs to beat the levels to get to the tree of life and restore it. To do so the player can move, jump, dash sideways and grow vines at specific places. These vines act like a trampoline at the tip and can make for an interesting parkour challenge.
